# CLAUDE.md — kairon AI Context

    > Session loader for AI work inside `kairon`.
    > Keep durable engineering rules in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and volatile facts in SSOT files.

    ## Load First

    1. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
    2. [`README.md`](README.md) when present
    3. The source files and tests directly related to the task
    4. Workspace context in [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) when the task crosses project boundaries

    ## Project Role

    - Layer: L2
    - Responsibility: 知识工程与研究引擎 monorepo
    - Stack: Python / uv workspace / pytest

    ## Commands

    ```bash
    uv sync
make test-diff
make lint
    ```

    ## Safe Editing Rules

    - `包清单和数量以 ../../docs/project-registry.yaml 与 pyproject.toml 为准。`
- 修改单包优先 make test-diff，跨包契约变更再扩大测试。
- 不要把派生日志或运行快照写进长期说明文档。

    - Do not commit, push, reset, or bump submodule pointers unless the user explicitly asks.
    - Preserve unrelated dirty changes in this repository.
    - Keep Markdown pointed at SSOT files instead of copying generated facts.

    ## Closeout

    ```bash
    git status --short
    uv run --with "pyyaml" python "../../bin/ssot/doc-ssot-lint.py" --json
    ```

    Report the checks you actually ran and any pre-existing dirty state that remains.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **kairon** (18989 symbols, 35261 relationships, 490 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .` (CLI fallback); report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "main" --repo .`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
